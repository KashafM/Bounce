In collaboration with two other team members (Anthony Shenouda and Eric) we attempted at creating an android game using Corona and the programming language Lua. 

This app is in rough stages but has all the functionalilty, just not the asthetics. 

The objective of the game is to dodge the items falling from the sky and pick up power-ups as the game progresses. If you are hit more than three times you lose the game. 

We used the Physics Library - specifically collision detectors and gravity to create cascading balls falling from the sky and event (tap) listeners to allow the player to move left and right.
